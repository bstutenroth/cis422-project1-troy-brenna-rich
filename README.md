The Geocoding_API_Test folder contains the files needed
to test out reverse geocoding using the google maps API.

(Use Run Test.bat to run it. Make sure that you have a
file named apikey.txt with a valid api key)

Make sure you've installed gpxpy to your computer,
wherever you store your python modules.
